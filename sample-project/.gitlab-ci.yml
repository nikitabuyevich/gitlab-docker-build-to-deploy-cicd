# Steps to run in the preceding order
stages:
  - cleanup
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  # Image name created from the docker-compose
  IMAGE_NAME: go-docker
  # Create the final image name
  # e.g., registry.gitlab.com/nikitabuyevich/go-docker:master
  FINAL_IMAGE_NAME: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME

Cleanup Unused Docker Images:
  stage: cleanup
  tags:
    - build
    - docker
  script:
    # Delete unnecessary images
    - docker image prune -f

Build Docker:
  stage: build
  tags:
    - build
    - docker
  before_script:
    # Login to the Gitlab Docker Registry
    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_JOB_TOKEN $CI_REGISTRY
  script:
    # Build with docker-compose
    - FINAL_IMAGE_NAME=$FINAL_IMAGE_NAME docker-compose build
    # Push build image to Gitlab's Docker Registry
    - docker push $FINAL_IMAGE_NAME

Run Tests:
  stage: test
  tags:
    - build
    - docker
  script:
    # Run tests through docker-compose using
    # the newly built image
    - FINAL_IMAGE_NAME=$FINAL_IMAGE_NAME docker-compose up --exit-code-from tests tests

Deploy to Prod:
  stage: deploy
  only:
    # Only runs in the master branch
    - master
  tags:
    # Only runs if the Gitlab Runner has a "deploy" tag
    - deploy
  before_script:
    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_JOB_TOKEN $CI_REGISTRY
  script:
    # Pull the built image from Gitlab's Docker Registry
    - docker pull $FINAL_IMAGE_NAME
    # Run the Docker image
    - FINAL_IMAGE_NAME=$FINAL_IMAGE_NAME docker-compose up --remove-orphans -d api
    # Cleanup older images which are no longer used
    - docker image prune -f
